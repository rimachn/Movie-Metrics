# Movie Metrics — User Viewing Behavior Feature Engineering

**Project Type:** Data Analysis 

## Objective
You've been given a table of Netflix users and another with their viewing activity, including the movie name, date started, and whether they finished it.

Your task is to engineer these new features for each user, based on their activity:

Date from the first movie they finished

Name of the first movie they finished

Date from the last movie they finished

Name of the last movie they finished

Movies started

Movies finished


## Tools Used
- Power BI 

## Notes
This project demonstrates how raw user activity logs can be transformed into structured behavioral metrics. The same techniques are widely used in streaming platforms, e-commerce, and digital product analytics.
